# First-Species-Counterpoint-Generator
Cantus firmus based counterpoint generator

This program takes a given classical music bass line, and generates a melodic line on top. The note selection algorithm is driven by the principles of "First Species Counterpoint", which is a simple musical practice that uses two voices, both functioning as independent melodies, but consequently generating harmony. The generator does not generate perfect first species counterpoint, but the intended use within the labanotation generating project allows for some imperfect harmonic and melodic progressions.
